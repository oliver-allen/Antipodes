# Antipodes
Node js program to find the antipodes of any location

The antipodes is the location on the other side of the world. It is the location where you would end up if you tunnelled through the centre of the Earth. Since the Earth is mostly covered by water, the antipodes of many cities is water. However, there are locations that have an antipodes on land.

## Run
1. Install the npm dependencies with `npm install`.
2. The node program can be run with `npm start`, which can be used through localhost port 3000 by default.
